# 🧠 SQL Mini Project – PostgreSQL + pgAdmin

This mini-project showcases my skills in **advanced SQL querying** using **PostgreSQL** and **pgAdmin**, applied to a business scenario involving customers, products, orders, sales, and profits.

## 📊 Key Skills Demonstrated

- ✅ SQL Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
- ✅ Window Functions:
  - `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`
  - `LAG()`, `LEAD()`
  - `SUM() OVER (...)` for running totals
  - `AVG(...) OVER (...)` for moving averages
- ✅ Aggregations: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`
- ✅ Grouping and Filtering: `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`
- ✅ Percent of Total Calculations
- ✅ Real-world business queries using multiple tables
